# MinaJS Accounts [Go from mnemonic to Mina account in seconds.]

The Accounts library is a wrapper and abstraction over Mina Signer and BIP39/32. It provides utilities to easily go from a mnemonic or a private key to a Mina account. It removes the need to manipulare data manually.

## Purpose

It wraps the standard base58 encoding and decoding, HD wallet libraries, and Mina Signer utilities to provide you with a handy abstraction in order to build quicker.
