# Klesia TypeScript SDK

Klesia has a TypeScript SDK to interact with the JSON-RPC API. The SDK provides type-safe interfaces and properties auto-completion.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @mina-js/klesia-sdk
```

:::warning
For now there are only [nightly builds](/klesia/sdk#nightly-builds) available. The stable version will be released soon™️.
:::

## Client Options

- `network`: The network to connect to. One of: `mainnet`, `devnet`, `zeko-devnet`.
- `customUrl`: A custom URL to connect to in case of self-hosted RPCs.
- `throwable`: If `true`, the client will throw an error if the response contains an error. Default is `true`.

## Usage

```typescript twoslash
import { createClient } from '@mina-js/klesia-sdk'

const client = createClient({ network: 'devnet' })

const { result } = await client.request<'mina_getTransactionCount'>({
  method: 'mina_getTransactionCount',
  params: ['B62qkYa1o6Mj6uTTjDQCob7FYZspuhkm4RRQhgJg9j4koEBWiSrTQrS']
})
```
