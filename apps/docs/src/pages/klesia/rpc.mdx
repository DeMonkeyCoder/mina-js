# Klesia JSON-RPC

Klesia is accessible via HTTP JSON-RPC. You can use any HTTP client to interact with it, but if you're building o1js zkApps, we recommend using the [Klesia SDK](/klesia/sdk). You can either use the version hosted by us, or follow [this guide](/klesia/rpc#self-hosting) to host your own instance.

## Endpoints

There are two Klesia instances available. One for Mina Mainnet and the other for Mina Devnet.

### Mina Mainnet
