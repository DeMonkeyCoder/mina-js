# Getting Started [Start with MinaJS Connect.]

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @mina-js/connect
```

### Nightly builds

```sh
$ npm install https://pkg.pr.new/palladians/mina-js/@mina-js/connect@main
```

## Find Mina wallets

To discover injected wallet providers, we've developed a Provider Discovery reactive store utility. [Check out the usage](/connect/provider-discovery).

## Window Polyfill

For your convenient TypeScript development, we've created a window polyfill. This will make sure you have an autocompletion for MinaJS compliant providers.

```ts
import '@mina-js/connect/window'

const account = await window.mina.request({ method: 'mina_accounts' })
```
