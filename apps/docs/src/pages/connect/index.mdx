# MinaJS Connect [zkApps and Mina wallets living in piece.]

The Connect library is a centerpiece of connecting your zkApp with Mina Protocol wallets. It provides a set of utilities to discover wallets, and interact with them in a seamless way, complying to the latest specs of Mina.

## Purpose

With MinaJS Connect we try our best to comply to the latest Mina Protocol specs regarding zkApps and wallets, so you don't have to. The Connect library complies with [RFC-0008](https://github.com/MinaFoundation/Core-Grants/blob/main/RFCs/rfc-0008-wallet-provider-api.md).
