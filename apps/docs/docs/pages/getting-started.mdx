# Get started [Get up to speed with MinaJS and Klesia.]

MinaJS is a set of packages and apps built by our team. The aim is to provide a modular solution, where you only pick elements necessary for your zkApp.

## SDKs

- `@mina-js/connect`
- `@mina-js/accounts`
- `@mina-js/klesia-sdk`

The libraries are available on npm. You can install them using npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun (yep, we support Bun).

```bash
# Install MinaJS Connect
$ npm install @mina-js/connect
